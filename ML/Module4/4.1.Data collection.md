- we want uh you know a system to uh see this image and recognize whether that image represents a dog or a cat okay so this is the problem statement we have so what we can do is we can feed images of dog and cat to our machine learning model okay so this can be any model so this can be a neural network or it can be a support vector machine model or anything okay so a machine learning model so what happens is so this model will find patterns in those images okay so let's say for example so if the eyes aresmall so it may represent a cat and if the size of the cat is you know if the size of the animal in the image is small it may represent scat right so all those kind of features will be recognized by our model so all those patterns will be recognized by our machine learning model and it will uh get the ielt power model to predict whether that image represents dog or cat so this is how we will use data in machine learning
