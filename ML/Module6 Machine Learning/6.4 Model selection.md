• modern selection and this depends on the dataset that we have okay so based on the dataset that we have we may need to uh use different kinds of models and based on the task that we do so task can be a classification test for a regression test so classification task is nothing but classifying uh something so it can be like predicting whether a person has a disease or not
• okay so in that in this case we are just predicting whether a person is having a heart disease or a person does not have our disease so we have two classes so again this is called as a classification problem and then we have a regression problem where we try to find some value so say for example we need to find uh or we need to predict the house price so price is nothing but a numerical value right so this type of problems is called as a regression problem and then we have recommendation problems etc okay so recommendation is that
• forecasting is there etc so depending on this task that we are doing the models that we select also changes and also based on the nature of a particular model

cnn stands for convolutional neural network

Support vector can be used both classification and regression as well--> when data set is very low and there are no out layers In the data --> in case of out layers SVM is not suitable--> when data set is too large then data processing time will be more so SVC wont work effectively 
Binary classifications where we have 2 classed like true or false --> Logistic regression

We will divide the data in to different sets and we will different set as test every tome and iterate it

Based on the accuracy score the logistic regression has 88 % so we can say it suits its best , it depends on the based on the data set
