• let's say that we have an x axis under y axis and we are taking some data
• so this is the data set that we have and we have plotted the values for x axis and y axis okay so now we need to find a model or a curve which can fit this uh you know data set so it is not possible to draw a line or curve which can pass through all the data points so we can just you know draw a curve like this that can you know almost pass through all the points so this is the trend that we are seeing in this particular line so the value doesn't increase much so when x value increases the y value doesn't increase much in the
• first case so it is almost uh you know uh the same and after a certain point the y value increases as the x value increases so this is the trend that we are getting for this particular data set so this is how the equation of this particular line may look like so this is not the exact equation i'm just giving you an example of how the equation will be for a line like this or a curve like this so this is an example for degree degree 3 polynomial
