In general terms below curve explains that up to certain point if weight increases then the height increased, but after certain point the high will not increase and the people might tend to get Obesity

Here for under fitting we are using linear model the line shows that if weight increases the height will increase but this is wrong 
In case of the overfitting there is no trend model tried to map all the data points

Similar to above if we are using different data bias is high and there is no changes in variance for underfitting 
Opposite in overfitting

In general we need a optimum model for that we need to adjust the bias and variance 
Blue line is bias and red line is variance and we have error line in this at middle we have less error values 
When ever we use less complex model we will have very high bias and low variance 
When ever we use more complex model we will have very less bias but high variance 
It is similar to underfitting and over fitting.

Regularization: x represent the feature and y will be out put 
Diamentsionality : Diamentsionality reduction is noting but the features more the values it tend to increase the failure of model 
We can use feature selection or other methods for this 

Ensemble method : we use 2 or 3 models together for better preduction
