Below we have logistic regression curve it will try to find if the person has diabetes or not

Loss function help use to find the distance between predicted values and actual value.
Ex: house price predection
Yi^ represents values predicted by our model 
Yi represents original values 
N represents number example 10 
This will help us for model optimization

Die will contains values from 1 to 6 go greater than 0.

P(5) = five can get only 1 time/ number ways 6
p(even)= total even values in the list is 3/ number of way or out comes 6

There are random vent occur and we want to assign numerical values to it example  assigning 0 to head and 1 to tail

â€¢ means that we have different values for a random variable for a particular event and we try to you know find out the values are distributed for these random values so this may be a bit you know confusing if you just watch this uh definition alone let's try to understand this with an example so let's say that we are tossing three coins in this case so and let's say that x is the random variable in this case and x is nothing but the sum of number of hits when three points are tossed okay
so we are tossing three points and if we get one coin as yet and the remaining two points are still then the random you know variable value will be 1 if we get 2 8 then the random variable value will be 2 and if we get to 3h the random variable value will be 3 and if we get all the you know points are scaled then the random variable value would be 0 because this is the one we are considering where random variable is the sum of the number of hits when three coins are tossed

we need to know so this is all about probability distribution and we may also call this as a discrete probability distribution okay so discrete means something that is uh you know distinct something that for which the value is fixed in this case the values are fixed as either yet or tail
