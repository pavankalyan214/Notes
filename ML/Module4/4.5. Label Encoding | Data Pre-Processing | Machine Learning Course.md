Label Encoding:
- converting the labels into numeric form
label encoding what is mean by this label encoding so label encoding is about converting the labels into numeric form okay so when we are working in a classification machine learning problem so classification problems are nothing but we will predict whether a data point belongs to one class or the other say for example uh we are predicting whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic so it is a classification problem whether in which we have to you know predict that this data points belong to one of these two classes okay so if the data are tells that that person is diabetic and non-diabetic so it is not easy to use that value so what we do is we convert the diabetic and non-diabetic these text values into numerical values as either 0 or 1.



# importing the Dependencies
```import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

Label Encoding of Breast Cancer Dataset

# loading the data from csv file to pandas dataFrame
cancer_data = pd.read_csv('/content/data.csv')
# first 5 rows of the dataframe
cancer_data.head()
```

# finding the count of different labels
```cancer_data['diagnosis'].value_counts()```

# load the Label Encoder function
```label_encode = LabelEncoder()```

Here we are converting the all the values of diagnosis as 1 or 0

```labels = label_encode.fit_transform(cancer_data.diagnosis)

# appending the labels to the DataFrame
cancer_data['target'] = labels


cancer_data.head()```

â€¢ now you may get a doubt or that which particular label gets the label as 0 and which you know label gets the value as 1 so because we haven't mentioned that a malignant case should get the value as 1 and then in cases should the value get the values are 0.so what happens is when you use this label encoder function the labels present in that particular column will be arranged alphabetically here the two labels we have are m and b so of course we know that b comes in alphabetical order at first so this b will be given the value 0 and as m comes after b so it will be given a value 1 so this is how we can do a label encoding on this particular best cancer data so the further processing we do will be to use this target on this feature to train a machine learning algorithm to make some predictions on whether a person has cancer in one end stage or malignant stage by you know going through this features

```cancer_data['target'].value_counts()
Label Encoding of iris data


# loading the data from csv file to pandas dataFrame
iris_data = pd.read_csv('/content/iris_data.csv')

iris_data.head()```

```iris_data['Species'].value_counts()```

# loding the label encoder
```label_encoder_1 = LabelEncoder()```



iris_labels = label_encoder_1.fit_transform(iris_data.Species)


iris_data['target'] = iris_labels


iris_data.head()
