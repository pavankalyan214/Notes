Data Standardization:
The process of standardizing the data to a common format and common range

• important data pre-processing technique which is data standardization data standardization is the process of standardizing the data to a common format or common range okay so what does this mean is so let's say that we have a data set and this data set contains 10 columns of data and there is a possibility that each column contains data in different range say for example one column can contain data in the range of unreaps and 200s and one column can
• contain the data in the range of thousands and two thousands and one column can contain the data in tens or twenties okay so we need to standardize this data to a common format and to a common range before feeding it to our machine learning algorithm because it's easier to do analyze analysis and the processing on this standard data instead of having an unstandard data

```bash
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.datasets
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```


# loading the dataset
```bash
dataset = sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
print(dataset)
```
• hese are the parameters which we will analyze to predict whether a person has breast cancer or not so there is this target variable right so zero represents that the person uh you know as uh breast cancer in benign stage and one represents the
• person as cancer in malignant stage so benign is nothing but the starting stages and malignant is the most advanced stages where you know the treatment becomes critical and they are in the advanced phase okay so this is what we are going to predict whether the person has the cancer in balance stage or um you know in malignant stage okay so this is the data set we have and we have these feature names

• feature names so we have this mean smoothness mean
• compactness mean concavity see these are uh the parameters of the cell okay so those cancer cells are analyzed and these values are you know got from those cancer cells using some uh medical scans okay so these are nothing but the feature names


• Will create the data frame as df so let's declare it as df and df is equal to pd dot data frame so this will create a data frame and inside that we need to mention the data which we want to put so as you can see here this data set we
• have named it as data set and this data contains all the numerical values all the data so we need to mention that inside this particular function so data set dot data and as i told you earlier the column names are present in the array called as feature names right so mention again dataset dot feature names okay so this dataset.
• data extracts all the numerical data and this feature names extract all column names


# loading the data to a pandas dataframe
```bash
df = pd.DataFrame(dataset.data, columns=dataset.feature_names)

df.head()

df.shape
```
• so we cannot manually standardize all the data onions we are using this standard scalar function which we have imported from sklearn.preprocessing okay so and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to uh put all this data in a single variable and i i'm going to take this all this target whether the cancer is malignant or benign in a different uh you know variable so i'll create the x and i'll store this data frame in this variable x and i'll create another variable y where i will store all these target values so these target values can be
• called by mentioning the data frame dot target
```
X = df
Y = dataset.target

print(X)

print(Y)

# we are splitting the data before standardizing the data because in case if any one data has more outlayers it will impact our model performance hence we are doing this 

Splitting the data into training data and test data

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)

print(X.shape, X_train.shape, X_test.shape)

```

Standardize the data

We need to check if our data is in same range or not for that we can use standard deviation
If we have data in same range then it will show the value as 1 
```
print(dataset.data.std())
```
228.29740508276657

Here the values is not 1 so our data is not standardized

we are going to use this standard scalar function so we have imported it from scale and dot pre-processing
```
scaler = StandardScaler()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81a2f388-2644-436a-b29f-859d0853ab22)
```
scaler.fit(X_train)
```
Transforming the data
```
X_train_standardized = scaler.transform(X_train)
print(X_train_standardized)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220880e2-1598-4853-8176-c004dc87470c)
```X_test_standardized = scaler.transform(X_test)
print(X_train_standardized.std())
print(X_test_standardized.std())
```
