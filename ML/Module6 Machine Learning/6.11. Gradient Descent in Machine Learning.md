• no matter where you start or no matter what the weight value and bias value you take so eventually you will reach this global minimum and this global minimum is the point that we need and at this global minimum we have the minimum loss function and at this minimum loss
• function the model will make accurate predictions so this is why the gradient descent as a u-shaped account so because if you just start in that point you will reach here if you start this point you will reach here so hence if you just take weight in the x axis and loss function in the y axis so if you plot the weight and the corresponding loss function for that particular weight so you will get a u shaped curve like this okay so this is all about gradient pressure so as i have told you there is a formula which we use to change this
weight value so as i have told you right so we will reiterate over the data and we will try to change the weight value again and again so that we reach that reach this point so there is a formula for this and that particular formula
