Range : in which the value reside example between 5 to 5.5

Standard Deviation: how much the individual values deviate from the mean or average values

Correlation: salary might increase if has more experience in this 2 variables are positively correlated.

Statistics used in machine learning to find the relation example you train and from test data it will predict, if you understand your data better its easy to find the model.

â€¢ six sigma is nothing but a strategy to improvise business processes or industrial processes let's say that there is a manufacturing plant that manufactures smartphones and in almost all the manufacturing plants there are some strategies
involved to improve their efficiency to improve their production rate and six sigma is one of those strategy that helps companies to find you know which places are you know can be improved in that business processes or in that uh manufacturing processes and out how they can efficiently improve that processes so this six sigma is one of those things which is completely relied on statistics.

descriptive means giving some descriptions giving some summarization to the data inferential statistics means finding some inferences from the data and finding some insights from the data okay

- population is large we take you know a sample of this population and we try to get some inferences from this data which helps us to make future prediction from this sample so this prediction made by the sample will be uh you know correlated with the population as well okay so because the sample represents the population right so you can see here so there is a population with various elements so we have a sample that represents the population
- crime variable here and if you come all the way down here this is price right so this vertical line is the value for price and this uh first horizontal line is for
- the crime rate we know that if the crime rate for a area is huge if it is more people are not going to buy houses in that area right and you can see a negative value a negative value of minus 0.4 that means prime rate and price of houses are negatively correlated if the crime rate is more people are not going to buy houses in that area and what happens is the house prices drop in that area right so we can say that crime rate and price are negatively correlated so negative correlation means if one value increases the other value
- decreases so you here you can say that if prime value increases price value decreases right so these two variables prime and price are negatively correlated now you can see the rm column here okay so rm represents the average number of rooms present in the house so if the number of rooms is more the house is going to be bigger and the price of the house is also going to be bigger right so you can see that here it has a positive value of 0.7 that means these two values are positively correlated the number of rooms and the price so here you can say that uh there is a positive correlation between a room and the price of the house where if one value increases which is rm the other value which is price also increases so these are two kinds of correlation which is caustic correlation and negative correlation so these are the inferences we can get from this data so you know there are several techniques so this is not just the only technique so correlation is not the only concept
in inference in certain statistics there are a lot of techniques in inferential statistics which we will use to get the insights from the data so once we get this insights we can also make future predictions using some analysis like regression analysis to find what is the price of the houses can be in this case so what we do is once we analyze the data we can train our machine learning model our statistical model which if you give all this data it can predict what can be the price of the house

percentage can have values from 0 to 100 and it tells how many values are below a particular data point

There is a form competitive exam and the students force about 40 percent type so 40 percentile means this you know there are about 40 percentage of the people who have scored less marks than that student okay so let's say that there are about one lakh students who have appeared for the exam for that particular competitive exam and one student scored about 40 percent that means 40 percentage of the people absorbed less than that particular student which means about 39 000 999 students have scored less than him so that is meant by a percentile 50 percentage other values are less than this so how you can find the percentile is take the number of values that are less than this and divide it by a total number of values so here there are about 7 values so you can divide 7 by 15.
so that's how you can find the percentile so percentile is different from from percentage so that's very important to note so percentile tells us how many values are less than less than a particular data point so let's take another data point so if you take this fourth data point we can calculate the percentile as how many data points are less than this so there are three data points which are less than this particular data point so it is 3 by 15.
so when you divide it you get 20th percentile okay and we can find the 80th percentile at this data points so this is the 13th value so 12 values are less than this so the value of this particular data point is 80th percentile

percentiles or quantiles are similar to each other but there is one significant difference so a quantile divides a group into equal sub groups okay whereas percentile can have any number of values so let's try to understand this with a similar example so again we have the same data set which contains height of 15 people and we have arranged these eight values in ascending order okay and we have a scale in centimeter and the first value is 160 centimeter and the last person has a height of 180 centimeter and we have a median value okay and now let's try to find the quantile so this is the median value which is 170 so you can see here we have uh discussed that a quantile is something that divides the members of the dataset into equally sized subgroups so if you take this median it will divide your dataset into equally sized subgroups because
left of this median there will be 7 values and right of this median there will be seven values so it is one you know quantile so this is a point five or fifty percentage quantile so sometimes we refer to quantiles in point five or we may represent it in fifty percentage so both of them are similar so this median value represents 0.
5 or 50 percentage quantile okay so now we have this particular subgroup and there is another subgroup here now this subgroups can also be divided into equally sized subgroups so if you take this particular data point it will divide this particular subgroups into two subgroups again so there will be three data points here and there will be three other data points here so this will be uh the subgroup for this case and this is the 0.
25 or 25th percentiles quantile and this will be our 0.75 or 75 percentage quantile so the important thing to note here is our quantile will split the data into equally sized subgroups
