the learning rate and the number of epochs so we can manually give the value for learning rate and number of epochs whereas we cannot give the values for this weights and biases the model has to determine the value of weights and biases depending on the data so that is the difference between model parameter and hyper parameters

If a person get a job or not 
person can have any name and their name does not influence whether that person will get a job or not so this particular column
six features are important for us to determine whether the person has a person can get a software engineering role or not now we need to give a numerical value to emphasize the importance of these columns and this is where weights will help us okay so we will assign some particular numerical value to this column so when it comes to name height and weight we know that these columns are not important right so
in this cases we can give the value of 0 to weight okay for name height and weight we can give the weight value as 0 and different columns have different weight values so each of these columns will have different weight values and it is not a common value so if there are about 9 features you will have nine different weight values and ah and this weight value is not constant for a different columns because we know that each column has separate uh you know importance so say for example the degree as a i weightage and the college
also has some weightage and this programming so these three columns as a i weighted when it when we compare it to degree and college and so on and number of backlogs this number of backlogs has a negative impact on the job of the person right if the person has 10 backlogs then we need to say that that person is not likely to get that job so in this case the weight will have a negative value so the positive columns or the positive features will have positive weights so the desirable or the favorable columns will have the positive
eight values the undesirable columns or uh then disable columns in the sense isn't the number of areas so it will have a negative uh weight value so that is one main thing that you need to understand so positive weights means that as a you know a positive result and ah negative eight means there will be a negative result if we have the i number of values in that particular column

wait is helpful for us to decide which column or which feature will influence the output

If you change the bias then the line will changes and slope also will change
