model over trains on the training data okay so what happens when it overtrains from the training data is that so this is the optimum uh model okay so if we try to fit a model or a curve to the data so this is a curve that we get so let's say that we have some variables in the x-axis and the output variables in the y-axis so the predictor variable can be the features let's say that we want to uh predict the salary of the person based on their work experience so in this case the work experience will be taken in the x-axis and the salary that we can predict can be taken in the y axis and we have some data points they say that uh if a person has an experience of five years they may make a salary of about you know six lakhs per annum or seven lakhs per annum something like that so this is the dataset we have with the experience y value and we have these many data points the green color points represent the data points okay and we try to fit a curve into this uh data points if it is an optimal model it will uh try to find a common trend in it so you can see a curve here so whereas if a model is over fitted you will get a curve something like this so the curve will try to uh you know join all the data points so you will get an irregular curve but this curve is actually kind of regular right so this is the difference between an optimal model and over fitting a model so a war fitting model tries to model the data too well so that's what it is you know given in this particular statement so modeling means it's try to fit into all the data points and when a model tries to fit into all the data points we get we cannot get a regular curve so when when we don't get a regular curve we cannot make a good predictions out of it
