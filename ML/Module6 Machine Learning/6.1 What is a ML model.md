 whenever we talk about machine learning there are two main things that comes to our mind one is data and the another one is machine learning models so these two are the main pillars of machine learning so what is meant by machine learning machine learning is a technique that helps us to make intelligent machines it helps them to do intelligent tasks so what we do in machine learning is we take a machine learning model and we feed a lot of data to this machine learning model so that it can learn from this data and it can make you know intelligent decisions i'll give you an example let's say that we want a system to see an image and tell whether the image represents a dog or a cad in that case what we will do is we will take a lot of data in this case the data will be images of doc and images of cad and we feed this data to our machine learning model our machine learning model looks at this images and it tries to find the pattern between all the docs and it will try to find the pattern between all the cats and once it learns from these images when you give a new image it can tell you whether the image represents a dog or cat this is how a machine learning models work this is how machine learning works so we feed the data to our machine learning model and it learns from it

here we have a set of values we have the values of x and some values of y so totally we have five set of values and the first law represents the x values and the second row represents y value now the value of y is related to the value of x so
y is a dependent variable and x is an independent variable because the value of y depends on the value of x and x doesn't depend on any value so x will be an independent variable y will be a dependent variable and we have uh here that if the value of x is 1 the value of y is 5 if value of x is 2 the value of y is 7 and so on so we have 5 set of values now we need to find the relationship between y and x okay so if you can find the relationship between these two variables you can clearly understand how a machine learning model
