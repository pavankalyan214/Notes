Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are interconnected fields within computer science, each with distinct characteristics:
	• Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broadest concept, AI encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns.
	• Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI, ML involves training algorithms on data to enable systems to learn from experiences and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.
	• Deep Learning (DL): A specialized subset of ML, DL utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data, excelling in tasks like image and speech recognition.
