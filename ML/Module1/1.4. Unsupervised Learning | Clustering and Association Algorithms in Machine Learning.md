-say that we get a project from from a mobile network company so they want us to suggest some ways on how they can increase their user base and how they can increase their revenue okay so they are giving us their user data and what we find is so we are feeding it to a clustering algorithm so unsupervised learning algorithm and this model is uh clustering the data into two clusters so okay so this is one possibility where people who are having i call duration may have very less internet usage and people who are having high internet usage may have high call duration okay so this is a possibility and now what we can suggest that network companies that they can give offers on internet usage for those people who are having a call duration and less internet usage okay and we can give offers on call durations for people uh who are having less internet uses and vice versa by this you know people tend to use both these features more okay so this is one way by which they can increase their revenue by you know where people can opt for both the plans
so this is one clustering example where the machine learning algorithm can cluster the data based on the user experience based on the user data

- let's try to understand about association so let's consider there is a supermarket and there are several customers who are buying these products specifically so customer base bread milk uh you know fruits and wheat so there is another kind of customers who are buying bread milk rice and butter okay so the important association between all these customers is that if someone buys bread that customer obviously is buying milk okay so this is one of the important uh you know relationship we have found and this is this can be used really well and when a customer buys a bread we can suggest them that they are they can buy milk so the third customer is most most probably is going to buy milk also okay so this is one of the method where we can use association

â€¢ let's see what are some important unsupervised learning algorithms so uh so apart from these five algorithms there are also several unsupervised moving algorithms but these five are very important algorithms so we have k means clustering hierarchical clustering which are examples of clustering examples and there is another algorithm called as principal component analysis which is used to reduce the dimensions of our data let's say for example we have a data set where it contains thousand rows and hundred columns so we want to reduce this dimension okay so the columns represent the features so we can use this principle component analysis algorithm to find which columns or which features are very important for our application okay so that is where principal component analysis is used and it is a type of an unsupervised learning algorithms where we won't give the machine learning algorithm any labels okay and there are other two algorithms apriori and eclat so these two algorithms are example of association task okay so these are some of the important
